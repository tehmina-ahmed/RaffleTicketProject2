## Abstract
The KaspasTill App was planned, designed and has been documented in this ReadMe.MD to show the process of the project. Agile Methodology was used throughout the project to ensure efficiency where possible. It's a Responsive till system App using CRUD functionality. Allowing users to Create an item, View the item, update it and delete it if need be. 
Kaspas LTD is an ice cream parlour that provides the user with the ability to create a dessert of choice and enter it into the MySQL database. The option for the user is to be able to Create a Dessert and a Topping (as their product of choice), to view it, update it and/ delete it based on their liking of the product. The idea behind this App is to give the user control of their products - essentially replicating the purpose of a self service till. This idea stems from a theory of customer journey where it is beleived that in modern times, the customer should be given more control of their product journey in order to ensure higher rates of satisfaction. This theory has been applied to the Till app to assess this hypothesis.

## Essential Features 
### Agile Methodology 
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" height="350" src="Asana.PNG">
</p>
Here is the Asana Kanban Board used to track tasks against time and the priority order of them. The Board displays tasks that were ordered into...
To-Do,
 In Progress, and, 
 Done 
This was helpful and was used as an online diary for me to keep track of my tasks. 

## Requirements - using Moscow Prioritisation

This technique allowed me to see which requirements would be essential to implement VS. requirements which would be a stretch goal. 

## Initial Documentation (before idea modification)

### User Stories 

FrontEnd                                                                                                          
:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

The user stories display the scenario of how the App interacts with the user indirectly, using a frontend to display the randomly generated results and 3 webApi's running in the background.
